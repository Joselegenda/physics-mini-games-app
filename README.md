# physics-mini-games-app
Final integrative project from Vanier College made in a team of four. The app hosts three educative mini games.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

The team had a significant interest in games, and noticed most people tend to make simple simulations to accomplish the goal of educating users about physics, math and chemistry. For that reason, we decided making a game would be the best way to engage a student in a fun learning experience. 

<h2>What it does</h2>

The application hosts three educative mini games that revolve mainly around physiscs concepts such as Electricty & Magnetism. Each game has a different look, objectives, and mechanics. Each game allows the user to follow the natural learning curve provided by trial and error. For instance, a student may only have an idea of refraction, but will end up fully understanding by experimenting directyly with parameters and inputs. 

<h2>How we built it</h2>

We used Java and JavaFX to make a main menu that allows the user to open any of the three games in a separate window. The process of building the games was split into three (for each game). Once all games were built, we integrated the main menu feature.

<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>

Given that each developer has their way of coding, there were many issues when the time came to merge the three games into one application. With enough inspection of files, we were able to sort out the parameters that were causing errors. Additionally, some of the physics concepts were not simple in their implementation as game mechanics - at least not with Java. These obstacles were also mostly overcome, and produced no major nuisances. 

<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>

We are proud of our implementations of physics concepts, as well as our unique approach to providing an immersive experience for users willing to learn.

<h2>What we learned</h2>

Throughout this project, and especially before starting the implementation, we learned the basics of project management and SDLCs. As a matter of fact, we each had to maintain a project management plan, Gantt chart, and control mangement documents. The rest was a test of our previously acquired knowledge.

<h2>What's next for Physics Mini Games App</h2>

Aside from small bug fixes, refinements, and optimization, the only thing we hoped to have completed was to make level generators, rather than hard code level setups.
